Hello, my name is Steffen. I am a Bachelor of Engineering in Robotics Technology, and this is a portfolio of some of my work.

At the moment, there is only a tiny Controller/Worker program for a RaspberryPi.

The schedule for uploads to this place is:
Friday the 11-02-2022: Classification network for Cifar 10 and Segmentation based on UNET should be uploaded
Monday the 14-02-2022: How many moves chess board algorithms
That is all for now.

I also have a YOLO v4, but it needs more work to pose-estimate fiducial markers.

I plan to update the original raspberryPI Fiducial marker tracker when I have time, but at the moment, life leaves me little free time.
