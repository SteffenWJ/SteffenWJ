Hello, my name is Steffen. I am a Bachelor of Engineering in Robotics Technology, and this is a portfolio of some of my work.

At the moment, there is only a tiny Controller/Worker program for a RaspberryPi and a HQ-Cam

The schedule for uploads to this place is:
[X] - 14-02-2022: How many jumps will it take for a KNIGHT to move from a start position to a end position.
Done was added the 13-02-2020.

From the 14 to the 25 i will be bussy i will see if i can get some time to test my Ceifer 10 classification network and my Segmentation network and get them uploaded.

After the 25th my development on my fiducial marker detector and camerea stream will be opdatet.

I also have a YOLO v4, but it needs more work to pose-estimate fiducial markers.
I plan to update the original raspberryPI Fiducial marker tracker when I have time, but at the moment, life leaves me little free time.
